#  Cycling Club Registration & Login System

A C# application for registering and logging in users of a **Cycling Club**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Dependency Injection (DI)**, **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**, and **Delegates** — emphasizing clean architecture and maintainable code.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this application is to provide a modular and scalable registration & login system using **Object-Oriented Programming principles** and **SOLID design**.  
The application simulates a club management environment where new users can register and existing users can log in securely.

##  Architecture & Design Principles

This project strongly follows **SOLID principles**, focusing mainly on:

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes.
  
- **Dependency Injection (DI):**  
  Interfaces and dependencies are injected at runtime for loose coupling and easier testing.

- **Delegates:**  
  Used for event-like scenarios and callbacks to make the validation and registration process more flexible.
